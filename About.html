But it doesn't stop there - PantryPal also provides a step-by-step manual, complete with AI-generated images for visual aid, making the cooking process more accessible and enjoyable. The goal of PantryPal is not just to make cooking easy, but also to make healthy eating more affordable.

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>PantryPal was born out of the recognition of the high cost of living in Vancouver, coupled with the desire to promote healthy eating and mindful consumption. Many residents are struggling to balance the need for nutritious meals with the financial constraints of city living. I also recognized the importance of sustainability in our consumption habits, particularly in the kitchen. Therefore, PantryPal was created to help users make the most of the ingredients they already have, encouraging them to buy only what they need and still create delicious dishes. The goal was to make healthy, sustainable cooking accessible and enjoyable, regardless of one's budget.</p>
